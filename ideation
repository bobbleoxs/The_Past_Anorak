The Past

Idea: 

Pick a building in its current form. Then go back in time. Users can look around the building and watch it back to the beginning. 

It'll be like 'choose your own path' with procedural generation of environments. So, we can graphically create a building or a path and be able to rewind or fastforward from that point.

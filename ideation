The Past

Idea: 

Pick a building in its current form. Then go back in time. Users can look around the building and watch it back to the beginning. 

It'll be like 'choose your own path' with procedural generation of environments. So, we can graphically create a building or a path and be able to rewind or fastforward from that point.

THE PAST: latest idea
  
  1. Format of the app will be an 'on-rails' experience.
  2. Since locomotion will be handled, the user will want to be able to look (possibly even click) at things to eperience a 'story'
  3. Procedural generation of geometry i.e. landscape, vegitation, houses, would be ideal - and fun
  4. implimentation of other features (i.e. 'rewind') will be assessed once core features are prototyped.
  
  BIG QUESTIONS TO ANSWER by 7/10/2017
  
  How is 'the past' represented.  
      are we benig toured on a linear path through a city starting in a metroplis and ending in a peasant village??
      are we being moved on loop of say a city block, where each building has 3 versions of itself (i.e. brand new, used, dilapidated/boarded up) and the user can click on said buidlings to cycle through their stages? 
      is Chris crazy because he keeps gravitating towards 'buildings' because he-is-an-architect-even-though-there-is-a-way-better-story-to-tell?
      
  What is the Story?
      to me the theme essentially influences the story, meaning, if we think the idea of the past is best represented by agging of buildings, then that IS the story.
